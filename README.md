# transportation_preferences_analysis

# Overview
This project entails an analysis of transportation preferences using data collected via Google Forms and analyzed using SAS (Statistical Analysis System). The analysis aims to understand the factors influencing daily transportation choices among diverse demographic groups.

# Analysis Techniques
The analysis primarily utilizes two statistical techniques:

T-Test: T-tests are conducted to compare the means of various variables across different clusters. Each t-test focuses on a specific variable of interest, comparing each cluster against a reference group or other clusters of interest. The t-tests yield p-values indicating the statistical significance of observed differences in variable means between clusters.
Chi-Square Test: The chi-square test is employed to assess the association between categorical variables such as transportation options, environmental reasons, and demographic characteristics. This test evaluates whether there is a statistically significant relationship between variables and cluster memberships.

# Results
The analysis identifies distinct clusters of commuters based on their transportation preferences, behaviors, and demographic characteristics. Each cluster exhibits unique patterns and priorities regarding transportation choices, reflecting the diverse needs and preferences of urban commuters.

Insights from the analysis can inform the design of more efficient, sustainable, and equitable transportation systems tailored to the preferences and priorities of different commuter clusters.
